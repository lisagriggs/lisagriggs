- 👋 Hi, I’m @lisagriggs
- 👀 I’m interested in how things function, games and sci-fi movies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, java and phython. Want to look into C++ too. 
- 💞️ I’m would love to make my own functionable application where it helps users remember ideas by just a trigger word.
- 📫 You can reach me on the twitter sphere here <a href="https://twitter.com/lali5a_">@lali5a</a>
